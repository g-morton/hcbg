# Half-Continent: A Board Game of Peril, Bureaucracy & Monster-Hunting

Welcome to the public repository for **Half-Continent**, a narrative-rich, strategy board game inspired by the world of *Monster Blood Tattoo* by D.M. Cornish.

This repository hosts digital resources for **playtesting**, **Tabletop Simulator (TTS) modules**, and development feedback. All components here are **not final**—they are prototypes for testing and refinement ahead of the game's physical release.

## 📖 About the Game

Set in the richly detailed Half-Continent, a pseudo-18th-century world teeming with bureaucracy, monsters, and esoteric science, players assume the roles of **Leads**, forming retinues and navigating narrative quests, faction intrigue, and monster encounters.

The game blends:

- 🎭 **Story-Driven Objectives** via card-based campaigns  
- 🕵️‍♀️ **Factional Bureaucracy Mechanics** inspired by HCBG suit types (Empire, Seas, Monsters, Light, Dark Trades, Mythic)
- ⚔️ **Dice-based Combat** featuring Lead and Cast characters vs. wild monsters  
- 🌍 **Modular Locations** representing the varied regions, societies, and institutions of the Half-Continent
