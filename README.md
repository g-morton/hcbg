# Half-Continent: A board game of peril, bureaucracy & monster-hunting

Welcome to the public repository for **Half-Continent**, a narrative-rich, strategy board game inspired by the world of *Monster Blood Tattoo* by D.M. Cornish.

This repository hosts digital resources for **playtesting**, **Tabletop Simulator (TTS) modules**, and development feedback. All components here are **not final** — they are prototypes for testing and refinement ahead of the game's physical release.

## 📖 About the Game

The game blends:

- 🎭 **Story-driven objectives** via card-based campaigns  
- 🕵️‍♀️ **Bureaucracy and scandal mechanics** inspired by the deep lore of the Half Continent
- ⚔️ **Dice-pool based combat** fast and fluid combat and encounters
- 🌍 **Modular locations** representing the varied regions, societies, and institutions of the Half-Continent
